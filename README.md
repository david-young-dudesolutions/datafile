# beer.db Quick Starter Datafile Templates 


## Usage

Use the `beerdb new <name>` to build yourself a copy. Example:

    $ beerdb new at

Will run the following steps:

- Step 1:  Download `at.rb` Datafile (from GitHub) to your working folder as `./Datafile`
- Step 2:  Run the `beerdb build` command
    - Step 2.a:  Download all datasets listed in the `Datafile` as zip archives (from GitHub) to `./tmp`
    - Step 2.b:  Create the "empty" database, that is, table structure, indexes, etc. (schema)
    - Step 2.c:  Read in all datasets from the zip archives in `./tmp` (no need to unpack)

That's it.
